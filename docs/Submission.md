-how you approached the problem

I made a plan from the start. I wanted two pages that are controlled by BrowserRouter. Their data would come from a redux store.
The api would be fetch at the start of the App and send to the store.

I decide to take the API Project B, because I had pictures and I thought it would make a better looking project.




-explain your reasoning behind any technical decisions you made (for example: libraries, coding paradigms used, etc)

I installed material-ui to make the app responsive easily and to get the slider component for the filter section
I installed also styled-component for the styling. I like to have to style local and close to my components.




-best practices or changes you would make if this were a real production app

Add some units tests and eslint
